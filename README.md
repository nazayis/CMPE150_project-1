# CMPE150_project-1.py

For our first CMPE150 project, we were expected to write a program that calculates stress levels 
and performs analysis based on reports of the emotions received from the input, entered by users.


In this assignment, participants must answer with one of the four values of "NO, MILD, MODERATE, and SEVERE"
as an answer for each emotion.The list of emotions that the user must report is as follows: Worry, Restlessness, Fear.
Users also need to report their gender as well. F for Female, M for Male. An example for the input format is: SEVERE NO MILD F 

The program will take a string as TASK, the number of participants as N, optional inputs specific to tasks and the entries of 
N participants. Then, it will perform analysis depending on the given task. An example input is:
